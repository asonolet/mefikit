# MeFiKit

**MeFiKit** (*Meshes and Fields Kit*) is a modern, high-performance library for
manipulating unstructured meshes and associated fields. It is designed with a
minimal, clear, and efficient interface, focusing on flexibility, correctness,
and integration in multi-physics simulations and mesh-based data processing
pipelines.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🧩 Mesh and Field Core
- Unified, ergonomic mesh format:
  - Supports **mixed element types** in the same mesh
  - Named **fields of doubles** over elements or nodes
  - **Element groups** for flexible subdomain handling

### 🔄 Input/Output Support
- Built-in support for major file formats:
  - `medcoupling`
  - `medfile`
  - `CGNS`
  - Custom formats with `serde`

### 🏗️ Mesh Builders
- Construct meshes programmatically:
  - Structured meshes (grid-like)
  - Extruded meshes (2D to 3D)
  - Fully unstructured meshes (manually)

### 🧠 Topological Toolbox
- Utilities for advanced topological operations:
  - **Descending meshes** (edges/faces of volumes, etc.)
  - **Mesh aggregation** (grouping meshes)
  - **Neighbor iterators**
  - **Equivalence classes** of elements
  - **Connected components**
  - **Tetrahedrization**, **polyhedrization**, and reverse operations

### 📐 Geometric Toolbox
- Geometric computation tools:
  - Bounding box trees
  - Element intersections
  - Close node merging
  - Normal and orientation computation
  - Barycenter and volume evaluation

### 🧮 High-Level Algorithms
- High-level, composable mesh operations:
  - `split_by(mesh_a, mesh_b)` – topological split of mesh A by mesh B
  - `conformize(mesh)` – resolve internal inconsistencies in a mesh
  - `fuse_meshes(mesh_a, mesh_b)` – boolean union + conformization
  - `intersect_meshes(mesh_a, mesh_b)` – boolean intersection
  - `substract_with(mesh_a, mesh_b)` – boolean subtraction
  - `build_intersection_map()` – for **field interpolation** and remapping
  - `crack_from_descending(mesh)` – internal face cracking

### 🐍 Python Bindings
- All functionality is exposed via clean Python bindings for rapid prototyping
  and integration in data pipelines.

## 💡 Why MeFiKit?

The internal mesh representation is designed for **simplicity and
performance**, closely matching the file format layout. Unlike MEDCoupling’s
complex (when mixed with MEDFile) and sometimes inefficient structure, MeFiKit
provides:

- 🚀 Better **runtime performance**
- 🧼 Clearer and **simpler interfaces**
- ⚙️ Easier integration and debugging
- 📦 Modern tools and clean build system (Rust/Cargo)
- 🧪 Robust testing & benchmarking suite
- 🧪 Pilot usage of rust in CEA’s **DM2S** simulations

## 🔧 Core API Overview

### `aggregate_meshes(meshes: &[UMeshView]) -> UMesh`
Concatenates meshes without modifying their topology or geometry.
- May result in **overlaps** or **duplicates**
- Fast, non-conforming operation

### `fuse_meshes(a: UMeshView, b: UMeshView) -> UMesh`
Computes the **boolean union** of two meshes, producing a **conforming**
result.
- Intersects overlapping elements
- Inserts new faces/nodes

### `intersect_meshes(a: UMeshView, b: UMeshView) -> UMesh`
Computes the **boolean intersection** of the two spatial domains.
- Returns only the overlapping region
- UMeshes are intersected topologically and geometrically

### `substract_with(a: UMeshView, b: UMeshView) -> UMesh`
Subtracts mesh B from A (`A \ B`), computing topological intersections where
needed.
- Useful for holes, notches, or subtractive modeling

### `split_by(a: UMeshView, b: UMeshView) -> UMesh`
Splits mesh A into sub-elements along the boundaries defined by mesh B.
- UMesh B acts as a "cutter"
- Preserves A’s domain while increasing resolution/conformity

### `conformize(mesh: UMeshView) -> UMesh`
Cleans and re-meshes a single mesh to make it internally **conforming**.
- Merges internal duplicates
- Optionally splits internal faces to improve element consistency

## 🔄 Mesh Ownership and Views: `UMesh`, `UMeshView`, and `UMeshViewMut`

MeFiKit uses a clear ownership model to distinguish between owned meshes and
views over mesh data. This makes integration with other systems (e.g., C or
Python) efficient and safe, while also enabling high-performance zero-copy
operations.

### 📦 `UMesh` – Owned Mesh

`UMesh` owns its data:
- Coordinate array (`ArcArray2<f64>`)
- Element blocks with connectivities, fields, families, groups

This type is used for:
- Internal mesh manipulation in Rust
- Persistent mesh storage
- File I/O
- Long-term computation or modification

It is constructed by cloning or transferring ownership of arrays.

---

### 👁️ `UMeshView<'a>` – Read-Only Mesh View

`UMeshView` is a **zero-copy, non-owning** view over existing mesh data. It
holds references (slices or `ndarray::ArrayView`) to memory that is managed
elsewhere (e.g., passed from a C/C++/Python array).

This is ideal for:
- Temporary views
- Foreign function interface (FFI)
- Avoiding unnecessary copies when no modification is needed

⚠️ Lifetimes must be respected — `UMeshView` is only valid as long as the
referenced data lives.

---

### 🛠️ `UMeshViewMut<'a>` – Mutable Mesh View

`UMeshViewMut` extends `UMeshView` to allow **in-place** modifications of:
- Connectivities (e.g., node merging or renumbering, but no pruning)
- Fields (e.g., updating values)
- Families and groups

This is used for:
- High-performance, localized updates
- In-place mesh transformations
- Efficient mesh modification during simulation

⚠️ Safe only when no aliasing or concurrency violations occur.

### 🔄 Summary

| Type           | Ownership | Mutable | Use Case                                 | Copies |
|----------------|-----------|---------|------------------------------------------|--------|
| `UMesh`        | Yes       | Yes     | Full ownership, long-term usage          | Yes    |
| `UMeshView`    | No        | No      | Read-only access to foreign/borrowed data| No     |
| `UMeshViewMut` | No        | Yes     | In-place modification of borrowed data   | No     |

This model ensures performance, safety, and clear interoperability boundaries.
